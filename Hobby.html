                        <p>This is my RC plane. I was able to finish it over a weekend, however it is still untested because I messed up one of the servo arms and I need to cut a new one. Being my first custom built plane, it is a kit from the company <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/" style="color: #83868a; text-decoration: none;">Flite Test</a> that came with almost all of the electronics and all of the material to assemble the airfoil (the plane is a flying wing design so it is pretty much 100% airfoil).</p>

                        <p>This is my science fair. Techincally, the paper is still incomplete, but the actual science fair design itself is finalized and is undergoing testing. The device measures conductivity to determine the prescense of salt in the water. This device could be useful in areas where road salt usage is high and they are unsure about if that road salt is causing runoff into the local water supply. Ultimately, though, it was not as successful as I wanted it to be due to the inability in picking anything but salts up.</p>
